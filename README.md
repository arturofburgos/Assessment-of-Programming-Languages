# Comparing Languages

Establishing efficiency evaluations and comparisons of different programming languages is not a trivial task.

The comparisons proposed in the present work address routines usually applied in CFD algorithms, i.e. solving system of linear equations, and changing vector element positions. The tests are Copying Arrays, Matrix Multiplication, Fibonacci's Sequence and solve a Linear System.

These are important tests because, in major CFD and Heat Transfer problems, it is necessary to set up a mesh grid and manipulate large amount of data.

The computer parameters are listed below, all tests were done in isolation so that there was no interference from third parties in the speed:

    -Name from Operational System: Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS\

    -Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6500U CPU @ 2.50GHz x4

    -Installed RAM: 15,3 GB
